#####Running: Simply download the rep with "git clone https://github.com/SanFranciscoSunrise/easyASCII" then make sure 
easyASCII.py is executable and run it as such "./easyASCII --help" for usage instructions.

#####About the source code:
This program is very simple yet powerful and I hope helpful to those of you who like to write cover pages and other documents in 
various asciiformats.  I eventually plan to place it into some sort of GNU/GPL but fornow just know that it is free to spread 
given that you reatain credit to me and any others who may contribute in the future.

#####About the program: 
Convert string text into BIG ASCII formats.  Utilize easy to create font files to select a font.  Run your text output 
vertically, horizontally, or word-per-line.  Output to a file.

#####Known Issues/ToDo:
[-] = Known Issue, [*] = Todo, [+] = Done

[-]  Still need to implement some sort of decision process with regaurds to file output. Giving the choice to append or 
overwrite a file that already exists.  It is currently just stuck in append mode (not such a bad thing given the the choice of 
the two).

[-]  Need a better way to implement symbols such as !@#$%^&*()_+=-`~/.,[]{}:"<>?.  Currently about 2/3 of them can be 
implemented into the font file directly but about 2/3 of those seem to need quotes around the phrase for them to print out 
without an error, which leaves an odd situation for quotes themselves.  The other 1/3 seem  to crash the program with or without 
quotes.  Fixing this would be a major help towards placing the program into it's first official release.

[*]  Please feel free to generate and submit your own font files.  Just email them over to me at SanFranciscoSunrise@Gmail.Com. 
It should be self explanatory what the format is, referr to asciiCharacters.ezfnt for an example of a font set I have created 
that works with this program, copy it, paste it, and alter to your liking.

Two caviats are that there must be an initial " single quote at the start of each row and as of now 7 rows of characters to draw 
out each individual ASCII character and no more.  If you would like to use less then 7 rows just fit your characters into the 
bottom few rows or somewhere in the middle.
#####Version History:
[+] Beta 1 : 08/17/2015 : First public release.  Let the cross-platform testing begin.
